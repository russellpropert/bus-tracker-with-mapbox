# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
This project tracks the route 1 MBTA busses that travel Mass Ave in Boston and Cambridge. The page displays one marker per bus and updates every 15 seconds. The bus locations are derived from real time data pulled from [https://api-v3.mbta.com](https://api-v3.mbta.com).

## How To Run
- Fork the repository
- Clone it to your machine
- Use npx http-server in the command line or the Live Server extension in VS Code to start a server.
- Navigate to the appropriate localhost port in your browser.

## Future Improvements
- Add some bus icons to replace the generic markers.
- Display the bus numbers above the icons.
